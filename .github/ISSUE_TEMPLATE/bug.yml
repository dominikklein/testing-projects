        Hi there - thanks for filing an issue. Please ensure the following things before creating an issue - thank you! ðŸ¤“

        ðŸ›‘ Please posts the following on our community board (https://community.zammad.org/):

        ðŸ‘‰ Feature Requests
        ðŸ‘‰ Development Questions
        ðŸ‘‰ Technical Questions (assistance for non paid / community)

        If you think you hit a bug, please continue:

        ðŸ‘‰ Search existing issues and the CHANGELOG.md for your issue - there might be a solution already
        ðŸ‘‰ Make sure to use the latest version of Zammad if possible
        ðŸ‘‰ Add the `log/production.log` file from your system. Attention: Make sure no confidential data is in it!
        ðŸ‘‰ Please write the issue in english
        ðŸ‘‰ Don't remove the template - otherwise we will close the issue without further comments
        ðŸ‘‰ Ask questions about Zammad configuration and usage at our mailinglist. See: https://zammad.org/participate

        Note: We always do our best. Unfortunately, sometimes there are too many requests and we can't handle everything at once. If you want to prioritize/escalate your issue, you can do so by means of a support contract (see https://zammad.com/pricing#selfhosted).
